# gmsv_query
Make changes to A2S_INFO and A2S_PLAYER packets being sent from your GMod server

# Original Repository
This is like 90% [gmsv_serversecure](https://github.com/danielga/gmsv_serversecure ). Totally copied and hacked together. 

This project requires https://github.com/danielga/garrysmod_common and https://github.com/danielga/sourcesdk-minimal
# Updated by me
So basically i used newest gmsv_serversecure and got A2S_INFO and got it to work, expect random crashes im not good at c++

maybe i'll get A2S_PLAYER to work in a few days -> DONE
